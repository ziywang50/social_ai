# Social AI – Generative Social Media Web App

This was a full-stack app I helped build during a GenAI-focused bootcamp. The goal was to create a social network where users could post AI-generated images using OpenAI’s DALL·E 3, browse others’ posts, and interact in a simple social feed.

## What I Built

I focused mainly on the front-end, building the user interface with React JS and React Router. I also implemented token-based authentication using JWT and helped connect the front-end to our Go-based backend (hosted on Google Cloud App Engine).

The app included:
- AI-powered image generation using DALL·E 3
- User login and post creation
- Personal and global feed views
- ElasticSearch integration for post search (on backend)

## Notes

Because this was built in a team during a bootcamp, I’m only sharing the parts of the project I personally worked on. The code here includes the React front-end and some mock data for demonstration.

## Tech Used

- React JS
- OpenAI API (DALL·E 3)
- Google App Engine (backend hosting)
- JWT for auth
