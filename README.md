# Social AI – Generative Social Media Web App

This was a full-stack app I helped build during a GenAI-focused bootcamp. The goal was to create a social network where users could post AI-generated images using OpenAI’s DALL·E 3, browse others’ posts, and interact in a simple social feed.

## What I Built

I primarily developed the front-end interface using React JS and React Router. I implemented token-based authentication with JWT and integrated the front-end with our Go backend, which is hosted on Google Cloud App Engine.

Features I contributed to include:

AI-powered image generation via DALL·E 3

User login and post creation

Personal and global feeds

Integration with backend ElasticSearch for post searching



## Notes

Because this was built in a team during a bootcamp, I’m only sharing the parts of the project I personally worked on. The code here includes the React front-end and some mock data for demonstration.

## Tech Used

- React JS
- OpenAI API (DALL·E 3)
- Google App Engine (backend hosting)
- JWT for auth
